<h3>About Ibis Neuronav</h3>
<p>The Intraoperative Brain Imaging System (IBIS) is developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute. IBIS is an experimental image-guided neurosurgery (IGNS) platform that is based on the opensource technologies Qt, VTK, ITK and OpenCV. It replicates most of the functionality of commercial IGNS systems while making it easy for researchers to develop new modules for their research projects using a plugin interface.
